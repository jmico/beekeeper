=head1 NAME
 
Beekeeper::JSONRPC::Response - Representation of a JSON-RPC response.
 
=head1 VERSION
 
Version 0.03

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $client = Beekeeper::Client->instance;
  
  my $resp = $client->do_job(
      method => 'myapp.svc.foo',
      params => { foo => 'bar' },
  );
  
  die unless ($resp->success);

  print $resp->result;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Objects of this class represents a JSON-RPC response (see L<http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification>).

When a RPC call is made the worker replies with a Beekeeper::JSONRPC::Response object
if the invoked method was executed successfully. On error, a Beekeeper::JSONRPC::Error
is returned instead.

Method C<Beekeeper::Client-\>do_job> returns objects of this class on success.

=head1 ACCESSORS

=item result

Arbitrary value or data structure returned by the invoked method.
It is undefined if the invoked method does not returns anything.

=item id

The id of the request it is responding to. It is unique per client connection,
and it is used for response matching.

=item success

Always returns true. Used to determine if a method was executed successfully
or not ($response->result cannot be trusted as it may be undefined on success).
