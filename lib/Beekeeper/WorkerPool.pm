=head1 NAME

Beekeeper::WorkerPool - Manage worker pools

=head1 VERSION
 
Version 0.03

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $ bkpr --pool-id MyPool start
  Starting pool of MyApp workers: beekeeper-MyPool.
  
  $ bkpr --pool-id MyPool stop
  Stopping pool of MyApp workers: beekeeper-MyPool.
  
  $ bkpr --help
  Usage: bkpr [options] {start|stop|restart|reload|check}
   --foreground      Run in foreground (do not daemonize)
   --pool-id    str  Worker pool name (mandatory)
   --user       str  Run as specified user
   --group      str  Run as specified group
   --config-dir str  Path to directory containing config files
   --debug           Turn on workers debug flag
   --help            Shows this message

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains the core of the command line tool C<bkpr> which is used
to manage worker pools: it start, stop and monitor pools of persistent
C<Beekeeper::Worker> processes which receive RPC requests from message bus.

When started it daemonize itself (unless C<--foreground> option is passed) and
fork all worker processes, then monitor those forked processes and B<immediately>
respawn defunct ones.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=head3 pool.config.json

Workers pools are defined into a file named C<pool.config.json>, which is searched
for into ENV C<BEEKEEPER_CONFIG_DIR>, C<~/.config/beekeeper> and C</etc/beekeeper>.
The file is in relaxed JSON format (so it allows comments and trailing commas).

All worker pools running on the host must be declared into the file, specifying 
which logical bus should be used and which services it will run. 

Each entry define a worker pool. Required parameters are:

C<pool-id> An arbitrary identifier for the worker pool.

C<bus-id> An identifier of logical bus used by worker processes.

C<workers> A map of worker classes to (arbitrary) config hashes.

The following example defines "MyApp" as a pool of 2 C<MyApp::Worker> processes:

  [{
      "pool-id" : "MyApp",
      "bus-id"  : "backend",
      "workers" : {
          "MyApp::Worker" : { "workers_count" : 2 },
      },
  }]

=head3 bus.config.json

All logical buses used by your application are defined into a file named 
C<bus.config.json> and specify the conection parameters to the MQTT brokers
that will service them.

Each entry define a logical bus. Required parameters are:

C<bus-id>: unique identifier of the logical bus (required)

C<cluster>: identifier of the cluster of logical buses that this bus belongs to (if any)

C<host>: hostname or IP address of the broker

C<port>: port of the broker (default is 1883)

C<tls>: if set to true enables the use of TLS on broker connection

C<username>: username used to connect to the broker

C<password>: password used to connect to the broker


The following example defines the logical bus "backend":

  [{
      "bus-id" : "backend",
      "host"   : "10.0.0.1",
      "user"   : "username",
      "pass"   : "password",
      "vhost"  : "/backend",
  }]
