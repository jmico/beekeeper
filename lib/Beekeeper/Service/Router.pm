=head1 NAME

Beekeeper::Service::Router - Route messages between backend and frontend buses

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.03

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $self->bind_remote_session( address => "frontend.user-123" );
  
  $self->send_notification(
      method  => 'myapp.private_message',
      address => 'frontend.user-123',
      params  => 'hello',
  );
  
  $self->unbind_remote_session;
  
  $self->unbind_remote_address( address => "frontend.user-123" );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Router workers shovel requests messages between frontend and backend brokers.

Additionally, routers include some primitives that can be used to implement session 
management and push notifications.

=head1 METHODS

=head3 bind_remote_session ( address => $address )

Make authorization data persist for remote caller session and optionally assign an 
arbitrary address to the remote client.

The authorization data can be used to store a session ID or other tokens which identify
requests as coming from a particular remote client.

If an address is provided it can be used to push notifications to the client. The same
address can be assigned to multiple remote clients, and all of them will receive the 
notifications sent to it. This is intended to allow to push notifications to users logged 
into multiple devices.

=head3 unbind_remote_session

Clear the authorization data and address assignment of a single remote caller session.

This does not affect other remote clients which share the same address. This is intended
to implement "logout from this device" functionality.

=head3 unbind_remote_address ( address => $address )

Clear the authorization data and address assignment of all remote clients which were
assigned the given address.

This is intended to implement "logout from all devices" functionality.
