=head1 NAME

Beekeeper::Service::Supervisor::Worker - Worker pool supervisor.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.06

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Supervisor worker is created automatically in every worker pool.

It keeps a shared table of the status of every worker connected to a logical 
bus in every broker, routinely checking local workers and keeping track of 
workers periodic performance reports.

=head3 worker_status

Handler for 'supervisor.worker_status' request.

This request is made by workers every few seconds and acts as a heart-beat.
It contains statistical data about worker performance.

Note that workers processing long tasks (like slow SQL queries) may not make 
this request timely.

=head3 on_worker_exit

Handler for 'supervisor.worker_exit' request.

This request is made by workers just before exiting gracefully. It is not made 
when a worker is terminated abruptly (as the process has no chance to do so).

=head3 check_workers

Check every worker process in this host (even workers in other pools) to
ensure that they are running, and measure their memory and CPU usage.

This is needed as workers with long blocking procedures may not report its 
status timely, and abruptly terminated workers has no chance to report that 
they had exited.

=head3 check_queues

In the case of all workers of a given service being down, all requests sent to
the service will timeout as no one is serving them. This may cause a serious
disruption in the application, as any other service depending of the broken
one will halt too for the duration of the timeout.

In order to mitigate this situation the Sinkhole service will be notified
when unserviced queues are detected, making it to respond immediately to 
all requests with an error response. Then callers will quickly receive an
error response instead of timing out.

=head3 get_workers_status

Handler for 'supervisor.get_workers_status' request.

Used by bkpr-top command line tool.

=head3 get_services_status

Handler for 'supervisor.get_services_status' request.

Used by bkpr-top command line tool.

=head3 restart_workers

Handler for 'supervisor.restart_workers' notification.

This request is sent by bkpr-restart command line tool.

=head3 restart_pool

Handler for 'supervisor.restart_pool' notification.

This request is sent by bkpr-restart command line tool.
