=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

C<Beekeeper::Worker> objects are created automatically by C<Beekeeper::WorkerPool>
after spawning new processes.

=head1 METHODS

=head3 on_startup

This method is executed on a fresh worker process immediately after it was spawned.
The connection to the broker was just stablished and the logger was initialized.

It is placeholder intended to be overrided in subclasses, which in their implementation
perform startup tasks and declare which job methods and notifications will be handled.

This is the place to initialize, for example, persistent database or cache connections.

After this method returns the worker will wait for incoming events to handle.

=head3 on_shutdown

This method is executed just before a worker process is stopped.

It can be overrided as needed, the default implementation does nothing.

=head3 authorize_request( $req )

This method MUST be overrided in your worker classes, as the default behavior is
to deny the execution of any request.

When a request is received this method is called before executing the corresponding
callback, and it must return the exported constant C<REQUEST_AUTHORIZED> in order to
authorize it. Returning any other value will result in the request being ignored. 

This is the place to handle application authentication and authorization.

=head3 log_handler

By default, all workers use a C<Beekeeper::Logger> logger which logs errors and
warnings to files and also to a topic on the message bus. The command line tool
C<bkpr-log> allows to inspect in real time the logs of the entire system. 

To replace this default log mechanism for another one of your choice, you must 
override the class C<log_handler> method and make that return an object implementing
a C<log> method.

For convenience you can import the ':log' symbols and expose to your class the
functions C<log_fatal>, C<log_alert>, C<log_critical>, C<log_error>, C<log_warn>, 
C<log_warning>, C<log_notice>, C<log_info>, C<log_debug> and C<log_trace>.

These will call the underlying C<log> method of your logger class, if the severity
is equal or higher than C<$Beekeeper::Worker::LogLevel>, which is set to allow 
warnings by default. You can increase the log level to include debug info with 
the --debug option of C<bkpr>, or from class config in file pool.config.json.

Using these functions makes very easy to switch logging backends at a later date.

All warnings and errors generated by the execution of the worker code are
logged, unless you specifically catch and ignore them.

=head3 Client methods

In order to make RPC calls to another services, methods C<send_notification>, 
C<do_job>, C<do_async_job>, C<do_background_job> and C<wait_all_jobs> are 
automatically imported from C<Beekeeper::Client>.

=head3 accept_notifications ( $method => $callback, ... )

Make this worker start accepting specified notifications from message bus.

C<$method> is a string with the format "{service_class}.{method}". A default
or fallback handler can be specified using a wildcard as "{service_class}.*".

C<$callback> is a method name or a coderef that will be called when a notification
is received. When executed, the callback will receive two parameters C<$params> 
(which contains the notification data itself) and C<$req> which is a
C<Beekeeper::JSONRPC::Notification> object (usually redundant unless you need to
inspect request headers).

Notifications are not expected to return a value, any value returned from its
callback is ignored.

The callback is executed within an eval block, if it dies the error will be logged
but otherwise the worker will continue running.

Example:

  package MyWorker;
  use base 'Beekeeper::Worker';
  
  sub on_startup {
      my $self = shift;
      
      $self->accept_notifications(
          'foo.bar' => 'bar',       # call $self->bar for notifications 'foo.bar'
          'foo.baz' => $coderef,    # call $self->$coderef for notifications 'foo.baz'
          'foo.*'   => 'fallback',  # call $self->fallback for any other 'foo.*'
      );
  }  
  
  sub bar {
       my ($self, $params, $req) = @_
       
       # $self is a MyWorker object
       # $params is a ref to the notification data
       # $req is a Beekeeper::JSONRPC::Notification object

=head3 accept_jobs ( $method => $callback, ... )

Make this worker start accepting specified RPC requests from message bus.

C<$method> is a string with the format "{service_class}.{method}". A default
or fallback handler can be specified using a wildcard as "{service_class}.*".

C<$callback> is a method name or a coderef that will be called when a request
is received. When executed, the callback will receive two parameters C<$params> 
(which contains the notification data itself) and C<$req> which is a
C<Beekeeper::JSONRPC::Request> object (usually redundant unless you need to
inspect request headers).

The value or data ref returned by the callback will be sent back to the caller
as response.

The callback is executed within an eval block, if it dies the error will be 
logged but otherwise the worker will continue running, and the caller will 
receive a generic error response.

Example:

  package MyWorker;
  use base 'Beekeeper::Worker';
  
  sub on_startup {

      $self->accept_jobs(
          'foo.inc' => 'inc',       # call $self->inc for requests to 'foo.inc'
          'foo.baz' => $coderef,    # call $self->$coderef for requests to 'foo.baz'
          'foo.*'   => 'fallback',  # call $self->fallback for any other 'foo.*'
