=head1 Tests::Beekeeper::Service

Base class for testing services.

=item start_workers ( $worker_class, %config )

Creates a temporary pool of workers in order to test the service.

Note that tests will fail if $worker_class was already used (as in 'use Foo::Worker')
as a proper service client must not depend at all of worker code.

=item stop_workers

Stop all workers. Called automatically when the test ends.
