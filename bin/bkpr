=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command line tool is used to manage worker pools: it start, stop and monitor 
pools of persistent C<Beekeeper::Worker> processes which receive RPC requests from 
message bus.

When started it daemonize itself (unless C<--foreground> option is passed) and
fork all worker processes, then monitor those forked processes and B<immediately>
respawn defunct ones.

Beekeeper applications use config files C<pool.config.json> and C<bus.config.json> to
define how clients, workers and brokers connect to each other. These files are searched
for in ENV C<BEEKEEPER_CONFIG_DIR>, C<~/.config/beekeeper>and then C</etc/beekeeper>.
