# Logical buses used in pool.config.json must be defined here, specifying the
# conection parameters to the STOMP broker that will service them. In this
# example two logical buses (named "frontend" and "backend") are defined.
#
# Each bus definition accepts the following parameters:
#
#  - bus-id  : unique identifier of the logical bus (required)
#  - cluster : identifier of the cluster of buses that this bus belongs to (if any)
#  - host    : hostname or IP address of the broker (required)
#  - port    : port of the broker (default is 61613)
#  - tls     : if set to true enables the use of TLS on broker connection
#  - user    : username used to connect to the broker (required)
#  - pass    : password used to connect to the broker (required)
#  - vhost   : virtual host on broker (ignored by some brokers)
