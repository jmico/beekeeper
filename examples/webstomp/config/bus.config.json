# Logical buses used in pool.config.json must be defined here, specifying the
# conection parameters to the STOMP broker that will service them. In this
# example two logical buses (named "frontend" and "backend") are defined.
#
# Each bus definition must contain the following parameters:
#
#  - bus-id : unique identifier of the logical bus
#  - host   : hostname or IP address of the STOMP broker
#  - user   : username used to connect to the STOMP broker
#  - pass   : password used to connect to the STOMP broker
#  - vhost  : virtual host of STOMP broker (may be omitted)
