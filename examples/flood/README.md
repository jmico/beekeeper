## Flood example

This example allows to estimate the performance of a Beekeper setup, which depends 
mostly of the performance of the message broker and the network latency. 


To run this example start a worker pool of `TestWorker` processes:
```
cd beekeper/examples/flood
source setup.sh
./run.sh
```
Then flood the worker pool with requests:
```
./flood.pl -b
```
Monitor the worker pool load:
```
bkpr-top
```
Finally stop the worker pool with:
```
./run.sh stop
```

Sample output running on a local Mosquitto 2.0.10:

### Mosquitto setup

This example uses the internal ToyBroker to allow being run out of the box.

To run this example on a fresh install of ![Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) set `use_toybroker` 
to false in config file `pool.config.json`. Then follow the instructions below to quickly setup a 
Mosquitto instance capable of running Beekeper applications with a minimal security.

Create `/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/beekeeper.conf`
```
per_listener_settings true
set_tcp_nodelay true

# Backend
listener 1883 0.0.0.0
protocol mqtt
max_qos 1
persistence false
retain_available false
persistent_client_expiration 1h
max_queued_messages 10000
allow_anonymous false
acl_file /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/beekeeper.backend.acl
password_file /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/beekeeper.users
```
Create `/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/beekeeper.backend.acl`
```
pattern  read   priv/%c

user backend

topic   readwrite   msg/#
topic   readwrite   req/#
topic   readwrite   res/#
topic   readwrite   log/#
topic   write       priv/#
```
Create a broker user running the following command:
```
mosquitto_passwd -c -b /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/beekeeper.users  backend   def456
```
Then the Mosquitto broker instance can be started with:
```
mosquitto -c /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/beekeeper.conf
```
If the broker is running elsewhere than localhost edit `bus.config.json` accordingly.
