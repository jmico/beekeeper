## Chat example

This example implements a real world setup with isolated buses and redundancy:

![](../../doc/images/chat.svg)


## Running this example

To run this example start all worker pools:
```
cd beekeper/examples/chat
source setup.sh
./run.sh
```
Then open `chat.html` in a browser (the JSON-RPC traffic will be dumped on browser console). 

Or use the command line client:
```
./chat.pl
```
The system can be stressed generating traffic with:
```
./flood.pl -c 50 -r 500
```
Monitor the worker pool load:
```
bkpr-top
```
Logs can be inspected with `bkpr-log` or with:
```
tail /var/log/myapp-pool.log
tail /var/log/myapp-service-auth.log
tail /var/log/myapp-service-chat.log
tail /var/log/beekeeper-service-router.log
```
Finally stop worker pools with:
```
./run.sh stop
```
MQTT network traffic can be inspected with:
```
tcpflow -i any -C -g port 1883
```
This is `bkpr-top` showing this example running:

### Mosquitto setup

This example uses the internal ToyBroker to allow being run out of the box, but to use actual 
WebSockets from `client.html` a real broker like [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) is required
(`client.pl` works fine with ToyBroker though).

To run this example on a fresh install of Mosquitto set `use_toybroker` to false in config file
`pool.config.json`. Then follow the instructions below to quickly setup a Mosquitto instance capable 
of running Beekeper applications with minimal security. 

Please note that the entire idea is to have the backend and frontend buses serviced by different broker 
instances, running on isolated servers. This setup uses a single broker instance for simplicity, and works 
just because topics do not clash (see [Brokers.md](../../doc/Brokers.md) for a proper configuration).

Create `/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/beekeeper.conf`
```
per_listener_settings true
max_queued_messages 10000
set_tcp_nodelay true

# Backend
listener 1883 0.0.0.0
protocol mqtt
max_qos 1
persistence false
retain_available false
persistent_client_expiration 1h
allow_anonymous false
acl_file /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/beekeeper.backend.acl
password_file /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/beekeeper.users

# Frontend tcp
listener 8001 0.0.0.0
protocol mqtt
max_qos 1
persistence false
retain_available false
persistent_client_expiration 1h
allow_anonymous false
acl_file /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/beekeeper.frontend.acl
password_file /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/beekeeper.users

# Frontend WebSocket
listener 8000 0.0.0.0
protocol websockets
max_qos 1
persistence false
retain_available false
persistent_client_expiration 1h
allow_anonymous false
acl_file /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/beekeeper.frontend.acl
password_file /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/beekeeper.users
```
Create `/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/beekeeper.backend.acl`
```
pattern  read   priv/%c/#

user backend

topic   readwrite   msg/#
topic   readwrite   req/#
topic   readwrite   res/#
topic   readwrite   log/#
topic   write       priv/#
```
Create `/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/beekeeper.frontend.acl`
```
pattern  read   priv/%c

user frontend

topic   read    msg/#
topic   write   req/#

user router

topic   write   msg/#
topic   read    req/#
topic   write   priv/#
```
Create broker users running the following commands:
```
mosquitto_passwd -c -b /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/beekeeper.users  frontend  abc123
mosquitto_passwd    -b /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/beekeeper.users  backend   def456
mosquitto_passwd    -b /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/beekeeper.users  router    ghi789
```
Then the Mosquitto broker instance can be started with:
```
mosquitto -c /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/beekeeper.conf
```
If the broker is running elsewhere than localhost edit `bus.config.json` and `config.js` accordingly.
