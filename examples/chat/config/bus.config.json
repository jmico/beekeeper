# Logical buses used in pool.config.json must be defined here, specifying
# the conection parameters to the STOMP broker that will service them.
#
# In this example four logical buses are defined, all residing in the same
# local broker. For development purposes is handy to use a single broker to 
# hold all logical buses and easily simulate a complex topology, but in 
# production enviroments is desirable to isolate brokers from each other.
#
# Each bus definition must contain the following parameters:
#
#  - bus-id  : unique identifier of the logical bus
#  - cluster : unique identifier of the cluster which the bus belongs to
#  - host    : hostname or IP address of the STOMP broker
#  - user    : username used to connect to the STOMP broker
#  - pass    : password used to connect to the STOMP broker
#  - vhost   : virtual host of STOMP broker (may be omitted)
