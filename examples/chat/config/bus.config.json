#
# Logical buses used in pool.config.json must be defined here, specifying
# the conection parameters to the MQTT broker that will service them.
#
# In this example four logical buses are defined, all residing in the same
# local broker. For development purposes is handy to use a single broker to 
# hold all logical buses and easily simulate a complex topology, but in 
# production enviroments it is desirable to isolate brokers from each other.
#
# Each bus definition accepts the following parameters:
#
#  - bus_id   : unique identifier of the logical bus (required)
#  - cluster  : identifier of the cluster of buses that this bus belongs to (if any)
#  - host     : hostname or IP address of the broker (default is localhost)
#  - port     : port of the broker (default is 1883)
#  - tls      : if set to true enables the use of TLS on broker connection
#  - username : username used to connect to the broker
#  - password : password used to connect to the broker
