# All worker pools running on this host must be defined here, specifying 
# which logical bus should be used and which services it will run.
#
# In this example two worker pools are defined. These are almost identical,
# but use different backend brokers in order to improve fault tolerance.
#
# Each pool definition must contain the following parameters:
#
#  - pool_id : arbitrary identifier of worker pool
#  - bus_id  : identifier of logical bus used by worker processes
#  - workers : a map of worker classes to arbitrary config hashes
#
# To start a the worker pools use the "bkpr" command:
#
# $ ./bkpr --pool "broker" start
# $ ./bkpr --pool "myapp-A" start
# $ ./bkpr --pool "myapp-B" start
