# Logical buses used in pool.config.json must be defined here, specifying
# the conection parameters to the MQTT broker that will service them. In 
# this example only one logical bus (named "backend") is defined.
#
# Each bus definition accepts the following parameters:
#
#  - bus_id   : unique identifier of the logical bus (required)
#  - bus_role : specifies if the bus is acting as frontend or backend
#  - host     : hostname or IP address of the broker (default is localhost)
#  - port     : port of the broker (default is 1883)
#  - tls      : if set to true enables the use of TLS on broker connection
#  - username : username used to connect to the broker
#  - password : password used to connect to the broker
